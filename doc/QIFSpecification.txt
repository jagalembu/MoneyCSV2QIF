Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) files
The Quicken interchange format (QIF) is a specially formatted text (ASCII) file that enables Quicken transactions to be moved from one Quicken account register into another Quicken account register, or to or from other programs that support the QIF format.

Note: For Quicken to translate data from a text file into the Quicken register as transactions, the text file must be in the QIF format.

Required File Formatting

Each transaction must end with a symbol, indicating the end of entry. Each item in the transaction must display on a separate line. When Quicken exports an account register or list, it adds a line to the top of the file that identifies the type of account or list. Listed below are the header lines Quicken adds to the exported files:

Header	Type of data
!Type:Bank	Bank account transactions
!Type:Cash	Cash account transactions
!Type:CCard	Credit card account transactions
!Type:Invst	Investment account transactions
!Type:Oth A	Asset account transactions
!Type:Oth L	Liability account transactions
!Account	Account list or which account follows
!Type:Cat	Category list
!Type:Class	Class list
!Type:Memorized	Memorized transaction list
Quicken can be configured to import all transfers, regardless of whether Ignore Transfers is selected when the file is imported. To do this, add a line to the file being imported into the Quicken account. Use a text editor or word processor to put the following line immediately after the header line at the top of the file:

!Option:AllXfr

Items for Non-Investment Accounts

Each item in a bank, cash, credit card, other liability, or other asset account must begin with a letter that indicates the field in the Quicken
register. The non-split items can be in any sequence:

Field	Indicator Explanations
D	Date
T	Amount
C	Cleared status
N	Num (check or reference number)
P	Payee
M	Memo
A	Address (up to five lines; the sixth line is an optional message)
L	Category (Category/Subcategory/Transfer/Class)
S	Category in split (Category/Transfer/Class)
E	Memo in split
$	Dollar amount of split
^	End of entry
Note: Repeat the S, E, and $ lines as many times as needed for additional items in a split. If an item is omitted from the transaction in the QIF file, Quicken treats it as a blank item.
